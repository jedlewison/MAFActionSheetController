 `MAFActionSheetController` manages action sheet-style view controllers on iOS 7+ using MAFOverlay to present as an overlay from a bar button item or a view.

 - Similar to UIAlertController, but with full control over layout and works with iOS 7+.
 - Default layout is similar to popover style on iPhone
 - Add custom header and footer
 - Supports vertical scrolling for long sheets
 - Choose primary and detail text attributes.
 - Supply a custom background view for each action item to completely customize appearance.
 - Uses MAFOverlay to coordinate presentations
